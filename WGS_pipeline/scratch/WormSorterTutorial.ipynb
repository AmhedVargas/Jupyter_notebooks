    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The COPAS worm sorter allows fluorescence screening of a large number of worms in a short time. However, the output of machine is hard to interpret. Worms that go in the COPAS sorter can go in straight or turned over themselves. If the worm is turned on itself, that will overlap the florescence expression of its body and will create a different expression pattern in the data compared to a worm that went in straight. The WormSorter package was created to help visualize the objects better. The package allows the user to create their own SVM model to distinguish good worms (Worms that went in straight) from other unwanted objects. In the future, we'll be updating the package so the models created can be used to distinguish different expression patterns in the fluorescence channels. \n",
